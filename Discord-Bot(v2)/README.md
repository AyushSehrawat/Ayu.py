# Discord-Bot (Version-2)

This is the better version of my Discord-Bot script with some needed funcitons of discord bot already in the script

## Requirements


`python -m pip install --upgrade pip`



`python -m pip install discord` `python -m pip install requests` `python -m pip install psutil` `python -m pip install json` are the things needed. If using a venv, please install these 2 prerequesties there!
